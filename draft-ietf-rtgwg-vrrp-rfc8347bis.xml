   This document describes a YANG data model for the Virtual Router Redundancy
   Protocol (VRRP). Both versions 2 and 3 of VRRP are covered.
 </t>
 <t>
   The VRRP terminology has been updated conform to inclusive language

<section title="Introduction">
 <t>
   This document introduces a YANG data model <xref target="RFC6020"/>
   <xref target="RFC7950"/> for the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
   (VRRP) <xref target="RFC3768"/>, <xref target="RFC9568"/>. VRRP provides
   higher resiliency by specifying an election protocol that dynamically
   assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the VRRP routers
   on a LAN.
 </t>

  <t>
   The YANG module specified in this document supports both
   versions 2 and 3 of VRRP. VRRP version 2 (defined
   in <xref target="RFC3768"/>) supports IPv4. VRRP version 3
   (defined in <xref target="RFC9568"/>) supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
 </t>

 <t>
   The VRRP terminology has been updated conform to inclusive language
   guidelines for IETF technologies.
   This document obsoletes VRRP Version 3 <xref target="RFC8347"/>.

<section title="Design of the Data Model">
<section title="Scope of the Model">
 <t>
   The model covers VRRP version 2 <xref target="RFC3768"/> and VRRP
   version 3 <xref target="RFC9568"/>. The model is designed to be implemented
   on a device where VRRP version 2 or 3 is implemented.  With the
   help of a proper management protocol, the defined model can be
   used to:
 </t>
   <ul spacing="normal">
    <li>
      Configure VRRP version 2 or 3.
    </li>
    <li>
      Manage the protocol operational behavior.
    </li>
    <li>
      Retrieve the protocol operational status.
    </li>
    <li>
      Receive the protocol notifications.
    </li>
   </ul>

<section title="Relationships with the Interface Model and IP Model">
 <t>
   This model augments the interface data model "ietf-interfaces"
   <xref target="RFC8343"/> and the IP management model "ietf-ip"
   <xref target="RFC8344"/>. The augmentation relationships are shown
   as follows:

 <t>
   In <xref target="fig-1"/>, a tree node without a prefix is from the model
   "ietf-interfaces". A tree node with prefix "ip" is from the model
   "ietf-ip". A tree node with prefix "vrrp" is from the VRRP model
   specified in this document.
 </t>

 <t>
   The "vrrp" container contains a list of "vrrp-instance" nodes,
   which are instantiated under an interface for a specified address
   family (IPv4 or IPv6).
 </t>

 <t>
   Each "vrrp-instance" node represents a VRRP router state machine, as
   described in Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC9568"/>, providing
   the configuration and state information for the election process of a
   virtual router.  The IP addresses on the augmented interface are
   the real addresses through which the VRRP router operates. The
   IPv4 or IPv6 address or addresses associated with a virtual router
   (described in Section 1 of <xref target="RFC9568"/>) are modeled
   as a list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses under the "vrrp-instance".

 <t>
   This model conforms to the Network Management Datastore
   Architecture (NMDA) <xref target="RFC8342"/>.
   The operational state data is combined with the associated
   configuration data in the same hierarchy
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis"/>. When protocol states
   are retrieved from the NMDA operational state datastore, the
   returned states cover all "config true" (rw) and "config false"
   (ro) nodes defined in the schema.
 </t>

 <t>
   The model allows the retrieval of protocol states at the following levels:
 </t>

   <ul spacing="normal">
    <li>
      VRRP instance (version 2 or 3), representing a VRRP router.
    </li>
    <li>
      Virtual IPv4 or IPv6 address associated with a virtual router.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tracking interface, to detect interface connectivity failures.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tracking network, to detect network connectivity failures.
    </li>
    <li>
      Global states and statistics summarizing all instances.
    </li>
   </ul>
</section>

<section title="Notifications">
 <t>
   This model defines the following VRRP-specific notifications (<xref target="fig-4"/>):

   change or error occurrence:
 </t>

 <dl newline="false" spacing="normal" indent="24">
   <dt>"vrrp-new-active-event"</dt>
   <dd>
     <t>
       VRRP new active event, indicating that a new active virtual router has been elected.

   </dd>
   <dt>"vrrp-protocol-error-event"</dt>
   <dd>
     <t>
      VRRP protocol error event for a message that fails to reach a VRRP
      instance to be processed.
     </t>
   </dd>
   <dt>"vrrp-virtual-router-error-event"</dt>
   <dd>
     <t>
       VRRP virtual router error event for a message processed on a VRRP
       instance.
     </t>
   </dd>
 </dl>

 <t>
   In addition to the notifications specified above, the mechanisms
   defined in <xref target="RFC8639"/> and
   <xref target="RFC8641"/> can be used for other general notifications.
   These mechanisms currently allow the user to:
 </t>
   <ul spacing="normal">
    <li>
      Subscribe notifications on a per-client basis.
    </li>
    <li>
      Specify subtree filters or XML Path Language (XPath) filters
      so that only contents of interest will be sent.
    </li>
    <li>
      Specify either periodic or on-demand notifications.

<section title="Operations and Management Considerations">
  <t>
    This document defines  YANG data model <xref target="RFC7950"/>
    for the VRRP protocol <xref target="RFC9568"/>.
    Hence, the entire document can be considered devoted to
    operations and management.
  </t>
  <section title="Migration Path">
  <t>
    The changes to use inclusive language (<xref target="changes"/>) are
    non-backward compatibly based on the rules in <xref target="RFC7950"/>.
    However, there are no existing implementations of the ietf-vrrp YANG module
    based on numerous implementation polls. Hence, it was agreed upon to
    change the YANG data nodes with non-inclusive language in a single
    iteration rather than going through the deprecation, obsoletion, and
    removal cycle.
  </t>
  </section>
</section>
<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
  This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
  of <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis"/>.
</t>
<t>
   The "ietf-vrrp" YANG module defines a data model that is
   designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
   NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> and RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.
   These YANG-based protocols (1) have to use a secure transport layer
   (e.g., SSH <xref target="RFC4252"/>, TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>, and
   QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/>) and (2) have to use mutual authentication.
</t>

<t>
    The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC8341"/>
    provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
    RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
    RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
</t>

<t>
   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
   default).  All writable data nodes are likely to be reasonably
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
   operations (e.g., edit-config) and delete operations to these data
   nodes without proper protection or authentication can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  The following subtrees and data nodes
   have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:
</t>

 <t>
   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/vrrp:vrrp/vrrp:vrrp-instance
 </t>

 <t>
   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/vrrp:vrrp/vrrp:vrrp-instance
 </t>

 <t>
   Unauthorized access to any data node of these subtrees can
   adversely affect the routing subsystem of both the local device and
   the network.  This may lead to network malfunctions, delivery of
   packets to inappropriate destinations, and other problems.
 </t>

<t>
    Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
    sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
    important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
    notification) to these data nodes. Specifically, the following
    subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
    vulnerabilities:
</t>

 <t>
   /ietf-vrrp:vrrp
 </t>
 <t>
   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/vrrp:vrrp/vrrp:vrrp-instance
 </t>

 <t>
   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/vrrp:vrrp/vrrp:vrrp-instance
 </t>

 <t>
   Unauthorized access to any data node of these subtrees can disclose the
   operational state information of VRRP on this device.
 </t>
